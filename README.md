# SageSites: A Philosophy-Based Geographic Game

## Concept Overview
SageSites is a GeoGuessr-style application that focuses on famous philosophical locations throughout history. Players are shown images of places where significant philosophical works were written or where philosophers found inspiration, and must identify the location. Timed hints featuring quotes from philosophical works written at those locations add an educational dimension to the gameplay.

## Key Locations

### 1. Plato's Academy in Athens, Greece
The first major institute of higher education in Western history, located in what is now a public park called Akadimia Platonos. Socrates and later Plato taught philosophy while walking these grounds, making it the birthplace of Western academic tradition.

### 2. The Lyceum in Athens, Greece
One of the other gymnasia of ancient Athens, most famous as the location chosen by Aristotle, one of Plato's students, for his own philosophy school.

### 3. Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots in Paris, France
Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir kept regular tables here in the 1940s and '50s. Sartre may have written his existentialist play "No Exit" here, and Beauvoir may have worked on "The Second Sex," her landmark feminist philosophical work.

### 4. San Casciano in Val Pesa, Italy
This is where Niccolò Machiavelli wrote his most famous work: "The Prince." Machiavelli was one of the most influential philosophers of the late fifteenth century and a key figure of the Italian Renaissance.

### 5. Friedrich Nietzsche's residence in Turin, Italy
At No. 6 Via Carlo Alberto in Turin, Nietzsche lived and wrote several of his important works including "The Antichrist," "The Twilight of the Idols," and "Ecce Homo."

### 6. Sils Maria, Switzerland
Friedrich Nietzsche stayed in this house for seven summers during the 1880s, another important location in his philosophical journey.

### 7. Socrates' Prison in Athens, Greece
In a far corner of the Agora in Athens, there's a quiet set of ruins where Socrates was imprisoned. This is where he would have delivered his final argument for the existence of the soul and drank the hemlock poison.

### 8. Agrigento, Sicily, Italy
This was the birthplace of the pre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles. The Archaeological Park of the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento holds an extraordinary heritage of philosophical culture.

## Game Mechanics

### Street View Integration
- Users see photographs or 360° views of philosophical locations
- They must identify where they are based on visual clues
- Points awarded based on proximity of their guess to actual location

### Philosophical Quote Hints
- After 30 seconds, a quote from a philosophical work written at that location appears
- Example: At Plato's Academy, users might see: "Wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder." - Plato

### Progressive Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Well-known locations with obvious landmarks
- **Medium**: Less famous sites with subtle clues
- **Hard**: Obscure philosophical locations requiring deep knowledge

### Educational Component
- After each round, show information about the location's philosophical significance
- Include brief biography of the philosopher(s) associated with the location
- Link to further readings or resources
