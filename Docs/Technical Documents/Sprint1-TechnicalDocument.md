# SageSites: Architecture & Sprint 1 Proposal

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architecture Style

SageSites will implement a modern, cloud-native architecture following a microservices approach. The system is designed with the following architectural principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business domains
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of components based on load
- **Resilience**: Fault isolation to prevent cascading failures
- **Flexibility**: Ability to evolve individual components independently
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging throughout the system

The application will follow a layered architecture within each service:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| Presentation | User interface components, responsive design, client-side processing |
| API Gateway | Request routing, authentication, rate limiting, request/response transformation |
| Business Logic | Core application logic, domain models, business rules |
| Data Access | Database interactions, caching, data consistency management |
| Persistence | Data storage, retrieval, and management |

3. **Sprint 4**: Social features and content sharing
4. **Sprint 5**: Analytics and learning progress tracking

Each sprint will build upon the foundation established in Sprint 1, gradually implementing the full feature set outlined in our requirements documentation.

## 6. Conclusion

The SageSites project will leverage modern web technologies to create an engaging educational platform that connects philosophical ideas with their geographical origins. Sprint 1 focuses on establishing the technical foundation and core gameplay mechanics, while future sprints will enhance the educational and social aspects of the application.

This architecture provides a scalable, maintainable framework that supports the project's requirements while allowing for future growth and feature expansion. The microservices approach enables independent development and deployment of components, facilitating a more agile development process.
